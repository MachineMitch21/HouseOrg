Please take the time to read over this document.
    
    All changes made to your tables are final.  Please ensure that you want to go through with an action before making any changes.
    There are four menu buttons at your disposal: Help, Modifications, Retrieve and Account.

    Anything with a * next to it shows its results immediately.  Every other action will need to be refreshed.  Use Retrieve when 
    adding and removing a house.  When adding and removing records (entries), you will need to click on the modified address to
    view changes made to that house table.

    The following is a description of each of the menu buttons and the items within their drop down menus:

    1. HELP
        Help is a link to this document for future reference.

    2. Modifications
        A. Add
            a. Add House brings you to a window in which you will specify the address of the house you want to add.
            b. Add record brings you to a window in which you will specify which house (by address) you want to add a record to,
                then you can fill out the form and submit.  This will insert your new record into the house table that was specified
                by address. 

        B. Remove
            a. House brings you to a window in which you will specify the house you want to remove.  This will remove everything related 
               to that house.
            b. Record brings you to a window in which you can remove a group of records from a specified address either by the date of the records
                or by the tenant.  This makes quick deleting of old records related to outdated data.
*           c. The third option will delete the current house that you have selected.    

        C. ViewBy..
            a. All will show you all the records for each table.
            b. Date allows you to view records that you added on a specific date.
            c. Tenant allows you to view records that you added involving a specific tenant.
            d. UpKeepCosts allows you to view records within a specified range.  The "From: " textbox specifies the low end of the 
                range and the "To: " textbox specifies the high end of the range.
    
    3. Retrieve
        A. Retrieve my address list will refresh you address list after a house has been added or removed.  Changes in the database are 
            not automatically shown through some actions.
    
    4. Account
        A. Sign out will sign you out of your current session and bring you to the sign in page.
        B. Delete my account will delete your account including all tables and records related to your account

* Note: When right clicking on a specific row in a table, you will be prompted with a button for deleting the selected record.  This has been added for 
        quick removal of single records.  You will also have access to the description you gave for the expense included in that specific record.  This will display
        a small textfield displaying your report.
